# Smart-Barrier-Arduino-Microcontroller-Project
This is a prototype smart parking barrier system built using an Arduino UNO, ESP32-CAM module, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and LEDs. The system automatically detects a vehicle approaching the parking spot and opens or closes a miniature barrier, while changing the color of the LED.

The ESP32-CAM module was initially intended for facial recognition to control the barrier, but due to technical issues with the module, it is currently used only as a surveillance camera. As an update, I will create the facial recognition with Raspberry Pi to improve the quality of the project and avoid the constraints that the ESP32-CAM module has.
